Student Tracker Revision 1:
===========================



General:

Student Tracker provides a means of cataloging student activities. All functionality described here is in the order one might go about setting up Student Tracker upon first use. Upon first use, a folder named "Student Tracker" is generated next to the Student Tracker application. This folder contains copies of all files related to students for quick access.



Setting Up School:

Under the file menu there are four items related to setting up and modifying a school-wide database. You will notice that the "Active School" is set to Default on first use. While setting up a schoolwide database is recommended it is not required. To set up a schoolwide database, first click the menu item labeled "Add School". This will prompt the user to type the name of the school to add. Once entered, the school database is created. To switch to this new database, highlight the "Change School" menu item and click the added school. Note that the "Active School" is now set to the name you entered.



Uploading A Student List:

To upload a student list, click the magenta button with a list and up arrow. This will prompt the user to select a list to populate the database with. The list selected should be a file copied from Seattle Public Schools. Specifically, the first line should contain the headers "Last Name" and "First Name" separated by a tab. For the user's convenience, other columns can be present, and the order of the columns does not matter. Once a list is selected, the student list should populate with names.

Entering letters into  the "Student Name" field will filter the list as you type, making it easier to find specific students quickly.



Adding A Student:

If a student is for some reason missing, they can be added by clicking the purple button with a person and a plus sign. The user is prompted to enter a name and after clicking the green OK button the name is added to the list.



Removing A Student:

If a student on the list is no longer needed, they can be removed. This is accomplished by clicking the student's name on the list once and clicking the blue button with a person and a minus sign.



Accessing Student Data:

Student data can be accessed by double-clicking a name on the list. It should be noted that students are not automatically added to the database, only once they are double-clicked from the list. Upon double-click, a window pops up with sliders for individual, group, and check-in counseling. Clicking these sliders for the first time brings up a dialog asking the user to confirm the start date. After confirming and clicking a second time, a dialog pops up asking the user to confirm the end date for that counseling. If these dates need to be changed for any reason, they can be accessed by clicking the "Modify dates" text. Notice that if both, start and end dates are entered, the slider fills and becomes grey.

Clicking the orange button with an arrow pointing toward a door and a plus sign prompts the user to add a walk-in appointment to the student. Clicking the purple button with an eye and an arrow pointing toward a door brings up a window containing a list of the walk-in appointments for the selected student.

Clicking the green button with a person in front of a document brings up more of the student's details. In this window there are three more sliders for IEPs. 504s, and in process evaluations.

Beneath these sliders are the student's forms. A form can be added by clicking the blue button with a form and a plus sign. This prompts the user to select a form. Once a form is selected, it is added to the forms list. Double-clicking on a form in the list will cause it to open in its default program. To remove a form, click it once in the list and click the orange button with a form and a minus sign.

Beneath the student's list of forms are miscellaneous notes related to the student. Simply clicking anywhere in the field and typing will modify this field. To ensure notes are saved, click the green OK button when done with this window. Otherwise, clicking the red cancel button will close the window and discard any changes to the student's notes.



Viewing Currently Enrolled Individual Counseling Students:

In the main student list window, clicking the red button with an eye and a person in front of a list will bring up a new window with a list containing all students currently enrolled in individual counseling. Clicking the blue button with a printer will cause the list to be sent to the default printer for the computer. The list will also be written to a file with its date of creation. This file is located in the Student Tracker folder that is created in the same directory as Student Tracker. In the "Student Tracker" folder double-click on the school the student is in and then double-click on the folder named "Printed Lists". The file can be identified by the date it was created followed by "Individual List".



Viewing Currently Enrolled Group Counseling Students:

In the main student list window, clicking the orange button with an eye and two people in front of a list will bring up a new window with a list containing all students currently enrolled in individual counseling. Clicking the blue button with a printer will cause the list to be sent to the default printer for the computer. The list will also be written to a file with its date of creation. This file is located in the Student Tracker folder that is created in the same directory as Student Tracker. In the "Student Tracker" folder double-click on the school the student is in and then double-click on the folder named "Printed Lists". The file can be identified by the date it was created followed by "Group List".



Archiving A Student:

If a student has left graduated or left the school their information can be archived by clicking their name in the student list followed by clicking the green button with a person and an arrow pointing to a stack of lists. Archiving a student removes them from the current student list and adds them to an archive. Once archived, students can be returned to the current student list.



Viewing Archived Students:

The archive for a school can be viewed by clicking the yellow button with an eye and a stack of lists. Doing so brings up a window with a list of all archived students. A student can be returned to the current student list by clicking the student followed by clicking the magenta button with a list and an arrow pointing to it beside a person. Returning a student to the current list removes the person from the archive.

Clicking the blue button with a printer will cause the archived list to be sent to the default printer for the computer. The list will also be written to a file with its date of creation. This file is located in the Student Tracker folder that is created in the same directory as Student Tracker. In the "Student Tracker" folder double-click on the school the student is in and then double-click on the folder named "Printed Lists". The file can be identified by the date it was created followed by "Archive List".

Double-clicking on a student brings up an inert student data. Navigating this menu is analogous to the steps in the section "Accessing Student Data" except no data can be modified. Sliders do nothing when clicked and date fields cannot be changed. To modify student data, the student must be passed to the current student list.
